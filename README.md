# Rubik's Cube Algorithm
Project By:
  Lila, Isaac, Cora, and Jack

## Description of Project
Algorithm for solving a Rubik's cube

## Background Information and Our Plan
We attempted to use an algorithm to solve a random or manually set (with input) Rubik's Cube. We researched many possible methods but settled on using an iterative deepening DFS and an IDA*. As we have learned, an IDDFA is a tree-traversal algorithm that uses less memory than a BFS. The IDA* calculates/estimates the distance between the current node (current  cube) and the goal node (solved cube) and removes nodes from the tree if it exceeds the search depth. 

## Implementation
We used six 2D arrays to represent each side of the cube

## Outcome
